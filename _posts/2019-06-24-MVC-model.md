**The model-view-controller or (MVC)** architecture is not unique to Rails. In fact, it predates both Rails and the Ruby language by many years. Rails, however, really takes the idea of separating an application's data, user interface, and control logic to a whole new level.

Let's take a look at the concepts behind building an application using the MVC architecture.

## MVC in Theory

MVC is a pattern for the architecture of a software application. It separates an application into the following components:

* Models for handling data and business logic
* Controllers for handling the user interface and application
* Views for handling graphical user interface objects and presentation

This separation results in user requests being processed as follows:

1. The browser (on the client) sends a request for a page to the controller on the server.
2. The controller retrieves the data it needs from the model in order to respond to the request.
3. The controller gives the retrieved data to the view.
4. The view is rendered and sent back to the client for the browser to display.

This is the kind of official guide, you can find everywhere when you search for MVC architecture.

So now, I'm goign to go into an unofficial guide which is inspired, by Ruby on Rails Seminar.

## Understanding MVC: an analogy

We have a couple characteres in the unofficial guide.There is our *'Model'*, Madeline, who is very smart, she loves data, knows all about data, but she's a little but anti-social and she doesn't usally interact with much peaples.

Next, threre's our "View", Vicky, who is georgous, but she's not so smart and lastly there's our "controllors", Cailtyn who really like ordering people aroud, but doesn't really like doing thing herself.

## Lets say our characteres all happen to work in CVS

### Scenario 1: a customer asks Vicki for a piece of candy from right in front of the register..

*What happens?*

Well, Vicki doesn't really know what to do, so she turns around and asks Caitlyn: "Catlin, what do I do? This customer just asket for candy."

Catlin, our very controlling manager says: "Well, the cady is right there, just give it to them!".
And so Vicky says, "Oh, okay, good". She hands the candy back to the customer.

*So, in this case, we're not even dealing whith our Model,
this is just a user went and clickedd on a link to your web page, the view is stupid, it doesn't really know what to do, so it has to ask: "what do I do with this information?". THe controller then hands back the appropriate page, and the view can display it.*
