>HTTP stands for *Hypertext Transfer Protocol*. It's a stateless, application-layer protocol for communicating between distributed systems, and is the foundation of the modern web. Ok so what?


## HTTP Basics

![http](/images/http.png)

Communication between a *host* and a *client* occurs, via a **request/response pair**. The client initiates an HTTP request message, which is serviced through a HTTP response message in return.

The current version of the protocol is HTTP/1.1, which adds a few extra features to the previous 1.0 version.

## URLs


At the heart of web communications is the request message, which are sent via Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
I'm pretty sure even your mom are already familiar with URLs, but for completeness sake, I'll include it here. URLs have a simple structure that consists of the following components:


![url](/images/url.jpg)

The protocol is typically `http`, but it can also be `https` for **secure** communications.

## Verb
URLs reveal the identity of the particular host with which we want to communicate, but the action that should be performed on the host is specified via HTTP verbs. Of course, there are several actions that a client would like the host to perform.

HTTP has formalized on a few that capture the essentials that are universally applicable for all kinds of applications.

These request verbs are:

* **GET:** fetch an existing resource. The URL contains all the necessary information the server needs to locate and return the resource.
* **POST:** create a new resource. POST requests usually carry a payload that specifies the data for the new resource.
* **PUT:** update an existing resource. The payload may contain the updated data for the resource.
* **DELETE:** delete an existing resource.

The above four verbs are the most popular, and most tools and frameworks explicitly expose these request verbs. `PUT` and `DELETE` are sometimes considered specialized versions of the `POST` verb, and they may be packaged as `POST` requests with the payload containing the exact action: *create*, *update* or *delete*.

There are some lesser used verbs that HTTP also supports:

* **HEAD:** this is similar to GET, but without the message body. It's used to retrieve the server headers for a particular resource, generally to check if the resource has changed, via timestamps.

* **TRACE:** used to retrieve the hops that a request takes to round trip from the server. Each intermediate proxy or gateway would inject its IP or DNS name into the Via header field. This can be used for diagnostic purposes.

* **OPTIONS:** used to retrieve the server capabilities. On the client-side, it can be used to modify the request based on what the server can support.

## Status Codes

With URLs and verbs, the client can initiate requests to the server. In return, the server responds with status codes and message payloads. The status code is important and tells the client how to interpret the server response. The HTTP spec defines certain number ranges for specific types of responses:

**1xx: Informational Messages**

>All HTTP/1.1 clients are required to accept the `Transfer-Encoding` header.

This class of codes was introduced in *HTTP/1.1* and is purely provisional. The server can send a `Expect: 100-continue` message, telling the client to continue sending the remainder of the request, or ignore if it has already sent it. `HTTP/1.0` clients are supposed to ignore this header.

**2xx: Successful**

This tells the client that the request was successfully processed. The most common code is *200 OK*. For a **GET** request, the server sends the resource in the message body. There are other less frequently used codes:

* **202 Accepted:** the request was accepted but may not include the resource in the response. This is useful for async processing on the server side. The server may choose to send information for monitoring.

* **204 No Content:** there is no message body in the response.

* **205 Reset Content:** indicates to the client to reset its document view.

* **206 Partial Content:** indicates that the response only contains partial content. Additional headers indicate the exact range and content expiration information.

**3xx: Redirection**

>404 indicates that the resource is invalid and does not exist on the server.

This requires the client to take additional action. The most common use-case is to jump to a different URL in order to fetch the resource.

* **301 Moved Permanently:** the resource is now located at a new URL.

* **303 See Other:** the resource is temporarily located at a new URL. The Location response header contains the temporary URL.

* **304 Not Modified:** the server has determined that the resource has not changed and the client should use its cached copy. This relies on the fact that the client is sending ETag (Enttity Tag) information that is a hash of the content. The server compares this with its own computed ETag to check for modifications.

**4xx: Client Error**

These codes are used when the server thinks that the client is at fault, either by requesting an invalid resource or making a bad request. The most popular code in this class is 404 Not Found, which I think everyone will identify with. 404 indicates that the resource is invalid and does not exist on the server. The other codes in this class include:

* **400 Bad Request:** the request was malformed.

* **401 Unauthorized:** request requires authentication. The client can repeat the request with the `Authorization` header. If the client already included the `Authorization` header, then the credentials were wrong.

* **403 Forbidden:** server has denied access to the resource.

* **405 Method Not Allowed:** invalid HTTP verb used in the request line, or the server does not support that verb.

* **409 Conflict:** the server could not complete the request because the client is trying to modify a resource that is newer than the client's timestamp. Conflicts arise mostly for PUT requests during collaborative edits on a resource.

**5xx: Server Error**

This class of codes are used to indicate a server failure while processing the request. The most commonly used error code is **500 Internal Server Error**. The others in this class are:

* **501 Not Implemented:** the server does not yet support the requested functionality.

* **503 Service Unavailable:** this could happen if an internal system on the server has failed or the server is overloaded. Typically, the server won't even respond and the request will timeout.

**Request and Response Message Formats**

So far, we've seen that URLs, verbs and status codes make up the fundamental pieces of an HTTP request/response pair.

![request](/images/request.png)

Let's now look at the content of these messages. The HTTP specification states that a request or response message has the following generic structure:

```http
message = <start-line>
*(<message-header>)
          CRLF
          [<message-body>]

<start-line> = Request-Line | Status-Line
<message-header> = Field-Name ':' Field-Value
```

It's mandatory to place a new line between the message headers and body. The message can contain one or more headers, of which are broadly classified into:

* [general headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.5) : that are applicable for both request and response messages.
* [request specific headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.3) .
* [response specific headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.2) .
* [entity headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7.1) .

The message body may contain the complete entity data, or it may be piecemeal if the chunked encoding (Transfer-Encoding: chunked) is used. All HTTP/1.1 clients are required to accept the Transfer-Encoding header.


**General Headers**

There are a few headers (general headers) that are shared by both request and response messages:

```http
general-header = Cache-Control
               | Connection
               | Date
               | Pragma
               | Trailer
               | Transfer-Encoding
               | Upgrade
               | Via
               | Warning
```

>The status code is important and tells the client how to interpret the server response.

* `Via` header is used in a TRACE message and updated by all intermittent proxies and gateways

* `Pragma` is considered a custom header and may be used to include implementation-specific headers. The most commonly used pragma-directive is Pragma:` no-cache`, which really is Cache-Control: `no-cache` under HTTP/1.1.

* The `Date` header field is used to timestamp the request/response message

* `Upgrade` is used to switch protocols and allow a smooth transition to a newer protocol.

* `Transfer-Encoding` is generally used to break the response into smaller parts with the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked value`. This is a new header in HTTP/1.1 and allows for streaming of response to the client instead of one big payload.


**Entity headers**

Request and Response messages may also include entity headers to provide meta-information about the the content (aka Message Body or Entity). These headers include:

```http
entity-header  = Allow
               | Content-Encoding
               | Content-Language
               | Content-Length
               | Content-Location
               | Content-MD5
               | Content-Range
               | Content-Type
               | Expires
               | Last-Modified
```

All of the `Content-` prefixed headers provide information about the structure, encoding and size of the message body. Some of these headers need to be present if the entity is part of the message.

The `Expires` header indicates a timestamp of whent he entity expires. Interestingly, a "never expires" entity is sent with a timestamp of one year into the future. The `Last-Modified` header indicates the last modification timestamp for the entity.

>Custom headers can also be created and sent by the client; they will be treated as entity headers by the HTTP protocol.

This is really an extension mechanism, and some client-server implementations may choose to communicate specifically over these extension headers. Although HTTP supports custom headers, what it really looks for are the request and response headers, which we cover next.

**Request Format**

The request message has the same generic structure as above, except for the request line which looks like:

```http
Request-Line = Method SP URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
Method = "OPTIONS"
       | "HEAD"
       | "GET"
       | "POST"
       | "PUT"
       | "DELETE"
       | "TRACE"
```

`SP` is the space separator between the tokens. HTTP-Version is specified as "HTTP/1.1" and then followed by a new line. Thus, a typical request message might look like:

```http
GET /articles/http-basics HTTP/1.1
Host: www.articles.com
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
```
Note the request line followed by many request headers. The Host header is mandatory for HTTP/1.1 clients. GET requests do not have a message body, but POST requests can contain the post data in the body.

The request headers act as modifiers of the request message. The complete list of known request headers is not too long, and is provided below. Unknown headers are treated as entity-header fields.

```http
request-header = Accept
               | Accept-Charset
               | Accept-Encoding
               | Accept-Language
               | Authorization
               | Expect
               | From
               | Host
               | If-Match
               | If-Modified-Since
               | If-None-Match
               | If-Range
               | If-Unmodified-Since
               | Max-Forwards
               | Proxy-Authorization
               | Range
               | Referer
               | TE
               | User-Agent
```
The `Accept` prefixed headers indicate the acceptable media-types, languages and character sets on the client. `From`, `Host`, `Referer` and `User-Agent` identify details about the client that initiated the request. The `If-` prefixed headers are used to make a request more conditional, and the server returns the resource only if the condition matches. Otherwise, it returns a `304 Not Modified`. The condition can be based on a timestamp or an ETag (a hash of the entity).

**Response Format**

The response format is similar to the request message, except for the status line and headers. The status line has the following structure:

```http
Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF

```
* HTTP-Version is sent as` HTTP/1.1`
* The Status-Code is one of the many statuses discussed earlier.
* The Reason-Phrase is a human-readable version of the status code.

 typical status line for a successful response might look like so:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```
The response headers are also fairly limited, and the full set is given below:

```http
response-header = Accept-Ranges
                 | Age
                 | ETag
                 | Location
                 | Proxy-Authenticate
                 | Retry-After
                 | Server
                 | Vary
                 | WWW-Authenticate
```

* `Age` is the time in seconds since the message was generated on the server.

* `ETag` is the MD5 hash of the entity and used to check for modifications.

* `Location` is used when sending a redirection and contains the new URL.

* `Server` identifies the server generating the message.
